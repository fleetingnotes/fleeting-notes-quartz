Note organization is very opinionated. There is no shortage of ways to organize notes and everyone seems to have their own method doing it. Although these methods are great for the short-term, as the number of notes grow it becomes very hard to manage these notes. 

Funnily enough, the very same thing happens to programmers as well. As code gets more complex it becomes harder to manage code. Now the difference between the two is that poorly managed code has real tangible consequences (e.g. more developer time = tons of money). Whereas the consequences of poorly managed notes are much less apparent (e.g. longer time to find information). For these reasons, I believe that code organization has innovated much further than note organization. So, there is much that note organization can learn from code organization. 

## The Main Principle of Coding
The main principle of coding is to write as little code as needed. The way we accomplish that is by following the 3 R's: Reuse, Recycle, Reduce. Wow! I didn't realize I can draw connections with the environment as well. Hopefully the analogy stands strong as I write this.

P.S. I know i messed up the order but this was the easiest way to explain it

### Reuse
One of the core concepts of coding are functions. A function is essentially a snippet of code that other code can "call" to run that function. It makes it so that we don't have to copy and paste the snippet of code everywhere. This makes it easier to:
- Reuse the code (reducing the amount we need to write + makes code easier to read)
- Oftentimes we don't need to throw out our waterbottle, we can just use it again.

### Recycle
Recycling
- Updating the notes  (update-one -> update all)
- sometimes we don't have use for our waterbottle and we want to repurpose it. (e.g. we bought a metal waterbottle)

### Reduce
- Basically using our functions, we reuse the amount we need to write.
- Sometimes we don't even need a plastic waterbottle, we can just use our metal waterbottle. 



## How to apply these concepts to your note-taking
As we live through our lives, we tend to come across similar concepts


Although there are still many ways to organize code, there are a few core concepts we can draw from coding to better manage notes. One is to 

I think code organization is at a much further stage then note organization because of all the . It takes longer to read code, code collaboration is especially important, and it's super easy to
