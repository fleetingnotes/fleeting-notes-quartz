- Need a way to have specific access, only share notes to specific ppl, or a group of ppl?
	- may need role based access as well. maybe just do shared email addresses as specific roles?
	- definitely an enterprise / premium plan thing

- ~~In the future, the end goal may be to use Fleeting Notes as a way to manage all notes (documentation, blogs, weekly reviews, meeting notes, etc.)~~
- **probably not, tbh. way out of scope**
